        "On one <ins>of my dresser sits a smiling toy clown on a tiny unicycleâ€•a gift I received last Christmas from a close friend. </ins> 
        The clown's short <em> made of yarn, covers its ears but is parted above the eyes. The blue eyes are outlined in black with thin</em> hair,, dark lashes flowing from the brows. 
        It has cherry-red cheeks, nose, and lips, and its broad grin disappears into the wide, white ruffle around its neck. The clown wears a fluffy, two-tone nylon costume. 
        The left side of the <mark>is light blue, and the right side is red. The two colors merge in a dark line that runs down the</mark>  center of the small outfit. 
        Surrounding its ankles and disguising its long black shoes are big pink bows.
         The white spokes on the wheels of the unicycle gather in the center and expand to the black tire so that the wheel somewhat resembles the inner half of a grapefruit. The clown and unicycle together stand about a foot high. 
         <q>As a cherished gift from my good friend Tran, this colorful figure greets me with a smile every time I enter my room.</q>
        Observe how the writer moves clearly from a description of the head of the clown to the body to the unicycle underneath. 
       <strike>More than sensory details for the eyes, she provides touch, in the description that the hair is made of yarn and the suit of nylon.
        Certain colors are specific, as in cherry-red cheeks and light blue, and descriptions help the reader to visualize the object:</strike> the parted hair, the color line on the suit, and the grapefruit analogy. 
      Dimensions overall help to provide the reader with the item's scale, and the descriptions of the size of the ruffle and bows on the shoes in comparison to what's nearby provide telling detail. 
      <small>The concluding sentence helps to tie the paragraph together by emphasizing the personal value of this gift.</small>
